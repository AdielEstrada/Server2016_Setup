# Setting Up Server 2016

## Software Used:
VirtualBox, Server 2016 Evaluation

## Obtaining Server 2016 ISO file

> Note that you first need to download virtualbox from the internet. You just look up virtualbox download on a browser, and it should be the first or second option. Look for an option to download that suits your computer specifications, and click download. Open the installation file and follow the prompts. From there, you should be set.

Open your web browser, and paste the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016

It should take you to a screen that looks like this:

From here, you could go on and download other versions of Windows Server. If you hover on the top where it says Windows Server, it will show a list of Server software that is available for download. But, for now, we will use Server 2016. So, click on "Download the ISO".

This will take you to a screen that says "Evaluate Server 2016" or something similar. On the side, a form will appear, just like this:

Fill in the relevant information. If you don't have a company (most don't), make up a company name and a role. It's just for information. The contact information you provide will help you obtain free training from microsoft if that is what you want. At the end of the form, you will find a blue button that says "download now". Click that button.

This will take you to a page where you are able to choose what version of Windows Server you want to try. In our case, we want to try the 64-bit ISO. So click where it says 64-bit edition.

> Make sure you locate where the file is downloaded. You could do this by going to File explorer, or by dragging the downloaded file to your desktop. The important thing is that you know where the file is, since you will need that information later.
